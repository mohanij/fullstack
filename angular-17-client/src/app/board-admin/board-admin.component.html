  <h2>Debugging and SSR Improvements </h2>
<p>In this version, major improvements have been made to ensure that developers can enhance the application building process and time and efforts are substantially saved. 
</p>
<h5>
Server-Side Rendering</h5>
<p>According to statistics, 76% of the Angular 17 apps that make use of prerendering or server-side rendering already use hydration. The lack of i18n support made it difficult for everyone to use it. Therefore, in the Angular 18 version, hydration for i18n blocks is available for developers in developer preview mode 
</p>
<h5>
Debugging Experience</h5>
<p>The Angular DevTools are updated to perceive Angular’s hydration process. Besides every component, you will find an icon presenting the component’s hydration status. An overlay mode can also be used to understand which component Angular hydrated on the page. Also, in the component explorer Angular DevTools will let you check the hydration errors in the application.
